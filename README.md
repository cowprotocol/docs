# CoW Protocol Documentation

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```bash
yarn
```

You will also need to `build` the app, to ensure external dependent projects are cloned and setup properly.

```bash
yarn build
```


### Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
