# CoW Protocol Documentation

The documentation is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Devcontainer

The easiest way to run this repo, is to open it in a Github Devcontainer from the main github page.

![create a devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.png)

Wait for the container to build (this can take some time).
Then either preview the current version, or make a change and then build an updated preview by typing

```bash
yarn serve --build
```

The preview should load in a new tab

### Installation

```bash
yarn
```

### Build

You will also need to `build` the app, to ensure external dependent projects are cloned and setup properly.

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Local Development

```bash
yarn serve --build
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
