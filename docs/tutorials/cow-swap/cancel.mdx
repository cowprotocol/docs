# Cancel

:::note

Before we begin, please note that our solvers can be quite quick, so it is entirely possible that your order will have already been filled before it can be invalidated.

:::

As CoW Protocol runs an off-chain order book, it is possible to cancel an intent before it is matched. This is done by signing an off-chain cancellation message and submitting it to the [OrderBook API](../../reference/apis/orderbook).

## Off-chain vs on-chain cancellation

Off-chain cancellations are _optimistic_ in that it signals to the order book that you no longer wish to trade. This is useful as it doesn't involve any on-chain transactions and is therefore free. Provided that the intent has not been settled on chain, it will be removed from the order book and will not be matched.

After you have selected "on-chain", click "Request cancellation" to submit the transaction. You will be prompted to sign the transaction with your wallet.
