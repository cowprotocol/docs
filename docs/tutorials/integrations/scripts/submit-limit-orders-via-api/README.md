# Submit Limit Orders via API

In case you would like to submit orders programmatically instead of via a UI, this tutorial will show you how to do that. There are a couple of reasons why you might want to do this:

1. Submitting “take profit” limit orders, where the current market price would not allow execution
2. Submitting on-chain orders without API interactions
3. Other more automated trading strategies

The general API documentation can be found here:[ https://api.cow.fi/docs](https://api.cow.fi/docs). We have also written a small[ trading bot script](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-trading-bot).
