Cancelling orders `off-chain` is free and does *not* require a transaction. However, there is a risk that the order is matched between the time you cancel it and the time the cancellation is processed `off-chain`.

:::note

Cancellations are not immediate, and your order may settle before the cancellation goes through.

:::

To proceed with an `off-chain` cancellation, click "Request cancellation" as shown below.

If you do not want to place trust in the API to cancel your order, you may wish to cancel your order via an `on-chain` cancellation transaction.
This will cost gas.
To do so, toggle the type of cancellation to `on-chain` by clicking on `off-chain`.

:::note

Even with `on-chain` cancellations, there is still a risk that the order is matched before the `on-chain` cancellation transaction is confirmed.
Make sure to set a high priority fee and sign swiftly.
