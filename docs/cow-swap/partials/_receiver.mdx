:::danger Warning

Ensure that the `receiver` address is correct. Fake CoW Swap websites have been observed and often substitute this parameter with their own address. 
This **should be set to  0x0...0 or your signer's address** to indicate that the tokens will be sent to the order signer's address. 
If you have set a custom receiver, you should verify that the address is correct.

The user interface should display a warning if the `receiver` address is not the address from which you are signing the order.

:::

Be careful when signing an order. 
All of the associated parameters are final and cannot be changed once the order is signed and submitted to the API. 
If you make a mistake, you will need to cancel the order and create a new one.
