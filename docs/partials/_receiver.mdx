:::danger Warning

Ensure that the `receiver` address is correct. Fake CoW Swap websites have been observed and often substitute this parameter with their own address. This **should be set to  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` or your signer's address** to indicate that the tokens will be sent to your signer's address. If you have set a custom receiver, you should verify that the address is correct.

The user interface should display a warning if the `receiver` address is not the address from which you are signing the trade intent.

:::caution

Be very careful when signing an intent to trade. All of the associated parameters are final and cannot be changed once the intent is signed and submitted to the API. If you make a mistake, you will need to cancel the intent and create a new one.
