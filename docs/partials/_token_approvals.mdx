:::caution

A user should be careful when signing approval transactions. Verify carefully that:

- The token address is correct (in this case {props.token}'s address)
- The spender address is correct (in this case {props.spender}'s address)
- The amount is correct

If in doubt about any of the above, do *not* sign the transaction. To review your approvals, you can use https://revoke.cash/.
