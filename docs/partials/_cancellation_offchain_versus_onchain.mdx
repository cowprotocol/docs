Cancelling intents off-chain is free and does *not* require a transaction. However, there is a risk that the intent is matched between the time you cancel it and the time the cancellation is processed off-chain.

:::note

Cancelling an intent off-chain removes your order from the offchain orderbook. The order will no longer broadcasted it to solvers starting with the next auction.
However, it is possible that it was already included in the current auction and thus executed by a solver before the next auction starts.

:::

To proceed with an off-chain cancellation, click "Request cancellation" as shown below.

If you do not want to place trust in the API to cancel your order, you may wish to cancel your intent via an on-chain cancellation transaction. 
This will cost gas. 
To do so, toggle the type of cancellation to "on-chain" by clicking on "off-chain".

:::note

Even with on-chain cancellations, there is still a risk that the intent is matched before the on-chain cancellation transaction is confirmed.
Make sure to set a high priority fee and sign swiftly.
