Cancelling intents off-chain is free and does *not* require a transaction. However, there is a risk that the intent is matched between the time you cancel it and the time the cancellation is processed off-chain.

:::caution

Cancelling an intent off-chain is **not** guaranteed.

:::

To proceed with an off-chain cancellation, click "Request cancellation" as shown below.

If you do not want to place trust in the API to cancel your order, you may wish to cancel your intent via an on-chain cancellation transaction. This will cost gas. To do so, toggle the type of cancellation to "on-chain" by clicking on "off-chain".

:::caution

There is a risk that the intent is matched between the time you submit the on-chain cancellation transaction and the time the cancellation transaction is confirmed.
