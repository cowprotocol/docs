If you intend to swap ETH frequently, consider wrapping some of your Ether into WETH to save on network fees.
The network costs of using the Eth-flow multiple times are typically higher than wrapping the native token a single time and swapping with WETH multiple times on CoW Protocol.
Moreover, non-native token swaps allow for gasless cancellations.
