# CIP-Draft: Template

CIP: <to be assigned when moved to phase 2>
title: <CIP title>
author: <a list of the authors name(s) and/or username(s), email(s)>
status: Draft
created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>
requires (*optional): <CIP number(s)>
replaces (*optional): <CIP number(s)>


## Simple Summary

If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Provide a
simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for gathering support within the community. Please
explain how your CIP is intended to advance CoW DAO and / or CoW Protocol, and
how it's aligned with CoW DAO's values.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new
feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be
reasoned about by participants in the CoW DAO.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the
design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe
alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also
provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss
important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
