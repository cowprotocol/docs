## Venues

Several governance venues are available to participate in CoW DAO governance, each serving its own particular purpose.

### [Forum](https://forum.cow.fi)

CoW DAO's forum is the main venue for governance-related discussion. Signing up for the forum allows community members to post and participate in discussions.

### [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth)

CoW DAO's snapshot space is a simple voting interface that allows members to vote on [CIPs](/governance/process/#cow-dao-improvement-proposals-cips). Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of vCOW+COW held or delegated to the address used to vote.

### [Discord](https://discord.gg/cowprotocol)

The CoW DAO Discord server is currently the main discussion hub for the CoWmunity and an informal place for governance discussions. The `governance-discussion` channel is where the governance matters and proposals can be discussed.
