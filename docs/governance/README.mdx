CoW DAO's forum is the main venue for governance-related discussion. Signing up for the forum allows community members to post and participate in discussions.

### [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth)

CoW DAO's snapshot space is a simple voting interface that allows members to vote on [CIPs](/cow-dao/process#cow-dao-improvement-proposals-cips). Votes on snapshot are weighted by the number of vCOW+COW held or delegated to the address used to vote.

The CoW DAO Discord server is currently the main discussion hub for the CoWmunity and an informal place for governance discussions. The `governance-discussion` channel is where the governance matters and proposals can be discussed.
