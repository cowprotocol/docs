# Program Structure

The CoW Grants Program operates under a structured governance framework as defined in [CIP-63](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xa83e2a3e98e9e4dfb41e54efdb94824a5e0e1ec9a2a381bc978ed46ef8f33a24).

## Committee Composition

The Grants Committee consists of five members:
- **3 Community Members**:
  - [@Kubesqrt](https://forum.cow.fi/u/kubesqrt)
  - [@Chim9](https://forum.cow.fi/u/chim9)
  - [@mfw78](https://forum.cow.fi/u/mfw78)

- **2 Core Team Members**:
  - [@middleway.eth](https://forum.cow.fi/u/middleway.eth)
  - [@Master_CoW](https://forum.cow.fi/u/Master_CoW)

The committee operates as a Gnosis Safe with a 4/5 quorum required for approving grants.

## Committee Roles

Each committee member may serve in one or more of these roles:

### Technical Lead
- Conducts technical assessments of grant applications
- Manages the technical infrastructure
- Provides technical guidance to stewards and grantees

### Grant Steward
- Serves as primary point of contact for assigned grantees
- Monitors and evaluates grant milestones
- Facilitates safe and timely execution of payments
- Consolidates grantee updates for the community

### Grant Moderator
- Screens applications and ensures timely reviews
- Monitors communication channels
- Maintains order and transparency in the process

## Safe Structure

As updated in February 2025, the Grants DAO operates with a streamlined Safe structure:

- The Grants Committee Safe ([`gno:0xCA1F000D520c21C47E6c634DD31b92b91A6338bD`](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=gno:0xCA1F000D520c21C47E6c634DD31b92b91A6338bD)) ([Gnosisscan](https://gnosisscan.io/address/0xCA1F000D520c21C47E6c634DD31b92b91A6338bD)) directly manages grant disbursements
- CoW DAO acts as the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) of the Committee Safe
- This structure improves operational efficiency while maintaining DAO oversight

## Decision Making Process

1. Grant proposals are submitted on the forum
2. The committee assigns a steward and reviewer
3. Community discussion and feedback takes place
4. The proposal moves to Snapshot for formal voting
5. With 4/5 committee approval, the grant is executed

## Grant Lifecycle Management

For each approved grant:
- A steward oversees the grant's progress
- A reviewer (internal or external) evaluates technical milestones
- Monthly payout cycles process approved milestone payments
- Regular updates are shared with the community

## Communication and Resources

- **Forum**: The [Grants Program Forum Section](https://forum.cow.fi/c/cow-grants-program/10) is the primary communication channel
- **Discord**: The #grants channel in the CoW Protocol Discord serves as a secondary communication channel
- **Snapshot**: All formal votes happen on the [Grants Program Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.box/#/s:cowgrants.eth)

For questions about the program structure, please post in the grants section of the forum.
