# CoW Grants Program Overview

The CoW Grants Program (CGP) funds initiatives that support the growth of the CoW Protocol ecosystem, aligned with the [CoW DAO mission statement](/governance/mission).

## Current Mandate

The Grants Program operates under [CIP-63](https://snapshot.org/#/cow.eth/proposal/0xa83e2a3e98e9e4dfb41e54efdb94824a5e0e1ec9a2a381bc978ed46ef8f33a24), approved in January 2025, which provides:

- A budget of 600,000 xDAI and 1,465,260 COW for grant activities
- An additional 4,990,000 COW allocated for volume grants
- Operating authority through January 31, 2026

## Focus Areas

The CoW Grants Program focuses on these key areas:

- **Community growth**: Growing the active user base and community engagement
- **UI/UX improvements**: Enhancing user interfaces and experiences
- **Decentralization**: Increasing network resilience and community participation
- **Solver ecosystem**: Developing new solvers and optimization algorithms
- **Developer tools**: Creating SDKs and resources for builders
- **Integrations**: Establishing partnerships and protocol order flow
- **Innovation**: Supporting novel ideas that benefit the ecosystem

## Committee Structure

The Grants Committee consists of five members (three community members and two core team members) who operate through a multisig with a 4/5 signing threshold. The committee evaluates proposals, assigns stewards and reviewers, and oversees the grant lifecycle.

The committee's operations follow the updated structure approved in CIP-63, allowing for efficient operations while maintaining DAO oversight.
