# Grant Types

The CoW Grants Program offers different types of grants to accommodate various project needs. Understanding the differences will help you choose the most appropriate structure for your proposal.

## Milestone-Based Grants

Milestone-based grants are designed for projects with clearly defined deliverables and outcomes.

### Key characteristics:
- Structured around specific, measurable deliverables
- Payment tied to completion of defined milestones
- Suitable for development projects, integrations, or research with clear outputs
- Each milestone includes detailed descriptions, deliverables, due dates, and funding amounts

### When to choose:
- Your project has clear, measurable deliverables
- You can break down the work into distinct phases
- You need funding based on completion of specific objectives

## Time-Based Grants

Time-based grants are not tied to specific deliverables but to the provision of time and effort over a period.

### Key characteristics:
- Based on dedicated time commitment rather than specific deliverables
- Suitable for ongoing roles, maintenance, or advisory services
- Can be structured by hours, days, or months
- Requires clear scope of work and responsibilities

### When to choose:
- Your contribution involves ongoing work or maintenance
- The value is in consistent effort rather than specific outputs
- Your role requires flexibility in addressing emerging needs

## Hybrid Grants

Some projects may benefit from combining aspects of both milestone and time-based grants.

### Key characteristics:
- Combines fixed deliverables with ongoing time commitments
- Allows for both structured outcomes and flexible contributions
- Must clearly specify which parts are milestone-based and which are time-based

The specific grant type must be clearly stated in your application and will be confirmed during the approval process.

## Bonus Allocations

As introduced in CIP-63, the Grants DAO Committee may award discretionary bonuses to grantees who demonstrate exceptional performance. These bonuses:

- Are capped at 10,000 xDAI or equivalent in COW per grant
- Do not require additional milestones or deliverables
- Are awarded at the committee's discretion for outstanding contributions
- May be given for exceptional results, significant ecosystem impact, or extraordinary efficiency
