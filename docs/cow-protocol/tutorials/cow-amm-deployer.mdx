# Deploying a CoW AMM

In this short tutorial, we describe how one can create and deploy their own Balancer CoW AMM.

The current Ethereum Mainnet factory contract is deployed in this address `eth:0x23fcC2166F991B8946D195de53745E1b804C91B7`.

1. In order to create a new pool, one first needs to call the `NewBPool` function of the contract. An example transaction that creates a new pool can be found here. https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7543a97853827e267ecd3c1309509ac7704e4f85a53fbfacd6060f461d85bad8#eventlog. The relevant `LOG_NEW_POOL` log also reveals the address of the newly created pool; in our example transaction, it is `eth:0x81530e9B069c69F6671A0A9d7Ee337cafEF419F6`

2. Once the new pool has been created, the next step is to approve the tokens we want to add to the pool; this can be done by calling the `approve()` function of the contract of the relevant ERC-20 token we are interested in adding to the pool, where the "spender" needs to be set to the newly created address.

:::caution

One needs to taken the token's decimals into account in order to set the correct approval.

3. The next step is to bind the approved tokens to the pool, by using the `bind()` function of the newly created pool contract. We need to do one bind per token that will be added to the pool. Note that the `denorm` parameter should always be set to 1000000000000000000 (i.e., 10^18)


4. We can then set the swap fee; this is the fee trades will pay if they trade permissionlessly (i.e., outside of the batch), and this is done by calling the `setSwapFee()` function of the pool contract. 
:::caution

The fee parameter is an unsigned integer where 10^18 corresponds to 100% of fee. Note that 100% is actually not a valid value though, but one can set up to 99.99% (this needs to be verified).

5. The final step is to finalize the pool by calling the `finalize()` function of the newly created pool contract.
