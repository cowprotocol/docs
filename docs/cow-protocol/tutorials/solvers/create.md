# Create a solver

## Requirements

Creating a solver requires knowledge of:

- Programming
- Optimization algorithms; or
- An easy route / path that is not yet used by the existing solvers

For the example below, we will use:

- Rust as the programming language
- Knowledge of a route that is not yet used by the existing solvers

## Idea

Let us consider the case of [Yearn](https://yearn.fi) tokens. A user has `USDC` and wants to buy `yvUSDC`. If no solver understands how to deposit into a Yearn vault, all solutions from solvers will require an LP `USDC/yvUSDC` to settle the order. But we know how to deposit into a Yearn vault, so we can create a solver that understands how to do that.

:::tip Get the big picture

CoW Protocol infrastructure is a lot of services running together in herd harmony, which is a bit intimidating at the beginning. Before proceeding, it would be advisable to read the architectural overview to get a better understanding of how CoW Protocol works and its entities.

### Setup

:::caution

it is assumed you have rust setup correctly with `rustup`.

:::


Let’s start simple. Let’s first run a solver which solves a json we send by hand with curl.

Start by cloning [https://github.com/gnosis/cow-dex-solver](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-dex-solver)

cow-dex-solver will give you a good idea of how a solver service is architectured.
You have a method called `solve()` which receives the batch `orders` and returns a `SettledBatchAuctionModel` aka a solution.

To run, exec:

```
cargo run -v
```

Once the service is running you can start throwing jsons at it.
I started reading the code and playing with different json setups calling:

```bash
curl -vX POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve" \
  -H  "accept: application/json" \
  -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "@/Users/user/dev/cow-dex-solver/sample.json"
```

You can get some inspiration from prod examples here: (insert example)

Make sure to test what happens when there is a **COW**!

### My solver code

I forked cow-dex-solver and wrote my first lines of rust.
You can check out my solver’s code at:
