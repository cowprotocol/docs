# Market orders (Swap)

Swapping is the bread and butter of CoW Protocol! Let's swap some tokens!

## Connect wallet
Go to [CoW Swap](https://swap.cow.fi/#/swap?utm_source=docs.cow.fi&utm_content=swap-tutorial) and connect your web3 wallet. 

:::note

If you don't have a web3 wallet yet, you can easily get one! Here are some suggestions:
- Use a browser extension wallet such as [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html)
- A hardware wallet such as [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)
- A Smart Contract Wallet such as [Safe](https://app.safe.global)

Please do your own research on the advantages and disadvantages of each wallet to select the one that works best for you.

Click on `Connect wallet`.

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_connect2.png')} alt="Pick one wallet from the available methods" />
Select one of the available wallets.



## Select tokens

Consider an example swapping 0.05 `WETH` for `COW`.

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_need_approval.png')} alt="GPv2VaultRelayer approval required" />

When you do a swap on CoW Swap for the first time, you must give approval for the [_vault relayer_](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core/vault-relayer) contract to spend your token (in this case, `WETH`). 
This is because this is the contract that will pull the `WETH` from your wallet and send it to the [_settlement_](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core/settlement) contract that will co-ordinate the swap on your behalf.

Both contracts are audited, battle-tested and non-upgradeable.

Moreover, the settlement contract is the only address that can request the vault relayer to pull your funds and **only after verifying** both that:
1. Your order was signed by you
2. and that you will receive at least your limit execution price or better

## Approve sell token

:::tip

Some tokens, such as `USDC`, `DAI`, `COW` and many others support gas-free approvals. This means that you can approve the [vault relayer](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core/vault-relayer) contract to spend your tokens without having any initial gas for an on-chain transaction. This is a great way to save on gas costs!

You don't have to worry about this, as CoW Swap will automatically detect if the token supports gas-free approvals and will guide you through the process.

Just look for the `Gas-free approval` flag when picking the tokens to get started:

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_gas-free_approval.png')} alt="Token selector showing a list of tokens matching the filter 'DAI', where some have the tag 'Gas-free approval'" />

:::note

Trade of gas-free compatible tokens is supported on Swap and [Limit](/cow-protocol/tutorials/cow-swap/limit) orders, and are NOT available for Smart Contract wallets.

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_approval_default.png')} alt="GPv2VaultRelayer default approval" />

By default, CoW Swap prompts you to give [vault relayer](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/core/vault-relayer) an "unlimited" allowance for the sell token.

This has the benefits of:

- Not having to re-approve every time you trade
- Saving on gas costs

<TokenApprovalWarning spender="GPv2VaultRelayer" />

Once the `approve` transaction is confirmed, you can proceed to swap!

:::tip

CoW Swap has a special integration with [Safe](https://app.safe.global) when opened as a [Safe app](https://app.safe.global/share/safe-app?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fswap.cow.fi&chain=eth), where the approval and order placement transactions can be combined into a single Safe transaction.

## Confirm swap

When you're ready to swap, click the "Swap" button. 

You will be prompted to confirm the swap. This is when you can review the details of the swap (i.e. the quote, the slippage tolerance, etc.). 

If you're happy with the details, click "Confirm Swap". You will be prompted to sign the order.

<ReceiverAndOrderWarning />

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_confirm.png')} alt="Confirm Swap" />

At this stage, your wallet will prompt you to sign the order. The user interface for this will vary depending on your wallet.

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_signing.png')} alt="Signing Swap" />

Once the order has been signed, it will be submitted to CoW Protocol where it is now ready to be executed! 🎉

<Image img={require('/img/cowswap/swap_confirmed.png')} alt="Swap confirmed" />

## Track your order
Your order will be in the order book and ready to be executed.

* CoW Swap will automatically notify in a pop-up message once your order is executed.
* You can keep track of the order status by checking the recent history (click on your connected wallet address in the top right corner).
* You can also view your order on [CoW Explorer](/cow-protocol/tutorials/cow-explorer).
