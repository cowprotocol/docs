# CoW Swap

[CoW Swap](https://swap.cow.fi) is the first interface built on top of CoW Protocol and serves as a reference implementation for developers wishing to build user interfaces for CoW Protocol.

The interface may look very familiar to the average DeFi user, as it is originally based on the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) interface. This provides users with a familiar user experience, while benefiting from the unique features of CoW Protocol.
