# Native tokens

In blockchain networks the native token, e.g. Ether (ETH) on Ethereum & DAI (xDAI) on Gnosis Chain, is the primary digital currency. 
It's essential for network operations, like paying transaction fees. 
Their "wrapped" token equivalents, e.g. Wrapped Ether (WETH) & Wrapped xDAI (wxDAI), are [ERC20-compatible](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) versions of native tokens. 
They're created to improve interoperability with decentralized applications and always allow to "wrap" or "un-wrap" into one another at a rate of 1:1.

CoW Protocol is only capable of handling ERC20 tokens.
This is because its intent-based architecture relies on solvers, or more precisely the vault relayer, to pull in the sell token on behalf of its traders.
Doing so is only possible thanks to ERC20's concept of approvals, which allow certain "spender" contracts to manage funds on your behalf.
As a consequence, native tokens cannot be directly traded on CoW Protocol.

However, there are two ways in which to still execute a swap from native tokens on CoW Protocol:

1. Wrap the native token into an ERC20 token (eg. `ETH` to `WETH`) and then swap it on CoW Protocol; or
2. Use the [Eth-flow](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/periphery/eth-flow) contract to place an order on your behalf.

## Wrapping native tokens

If a user decides to wrap their native tokens to trade, they must follow three steps:

1. Wrap the native token into it's wrapped ERC20 counterpart (on-chain transaction)
2. Approve the wrapped token to be spent by the CoW Protocol (on-chain transaction)
3. Swap the wrapped token on CoW Protocol to the desired token (off-chain signed intent)

The CoW Swap UI has built-in support for wrapping native tokens. Simply select the native token you want to wrap and it's wrapped ERC20 counterpart (e.g. `ETH` and `WETH`).

## Eth-flow

In an attempt to smooth the user experience, CoW Protocol has introduced the [Eth-flow](/cow-protocol/reference/contracts/periphery/eth-flow) contract. This allows users to automate the [above process](#wrap-native-tokens), all in one **on-chain** transaction.

Using Eth-flow is transparent to the user in CoW Swap, simply select the native token you want to swap and the desired token. CoW Swap will automatically detect if the native token needs to be wrapped and will execute the Eth-flow contract on your behalf.

After selecting your tokens, CoW Swap will prompt you to confirm the swap. This will be a single on-chain transaction that will wrap your native tokens (if required) and place the swap intent on CoW Protocol.

Once you have confirmed the swap, your wallet will prompt you to the on-chain transaction interacting with Eth-flow. On completion of this transaction, your swap intent will be placed on CoW Protocol:

:::note

When using Eth-flow, your order is only placed once the transaction that sends your ETH into the Eth-flow contract is confirmed.
This means you may see ETH missing in your account before the buy tokens arrive.
Fear not, if your orders expires, your ETH can be refunded into your account.
The refund can be triggered by any account and should happen automatically in case you used the CoW Swap UI.
