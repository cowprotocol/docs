# Make your Safe App

With over [100 Billon secured asserts](https://x.com/SchorLukas/status/1765865822797410466), Safe is a multi-signature wallet that allows users to manage their assets in a secure and decentralized way.

Safe Dapps, are third party interfaces that live inside the [Safe Wallet Web](https://app.safe.global) and allow users to interact with deFI protocols with a customised user experience.

[CoW Protocol Widget](https://widget.cow.fi) has a deep integration with Safe Dapps, which allows anyone building a Safe Dapp to add seamlessly add trading functionality to their interface.

Safe App projects would be interested in using this feature to:
* üß±Cut costs by not having to build a trading interface from scratch
* ‚òîÔ∏è Offer their users all CoW Protocol innovations, like protection from MEV, Just in Time Liquidity path finding (optimised for Multisig flows), batching of transactions and more.
* ü§ë Create a revenew model for yuor Dapp by using the `partnerFee` (see [Fees](/governance/fees#partner-fees))
