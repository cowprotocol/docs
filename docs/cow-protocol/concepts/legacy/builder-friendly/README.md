# Builder friendly

With a strong focus on welcoming builders to the protocol, CoW Protocol is designed to be as developer friendly as possible. The protocol is built with a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily build on top of the protocol and extend its functionality.

Areas that are welcoming to builders include:

- [Programmatic orders](programmatic)
    - [Composable CoW](./builder-friendly/composable-cow)
- [Solvers](../../tutorials/solvers/create)
- [Hooks](cow-hooks)

## Built on CoW Protocol

The Grants DAO is a community-run DAO that funds projects that build on top of CoW Protocol. Successfully funded projects include:

* [Milkman](./builder-friendly/milkman) - A way for users to initiate a swap and ensure that their price is respected by the protocol
* [Composable CoW](./builder-friendly/composable-cow) - A way for developers to build conditional orders on top of CoW Protocol's support for programmatic orders
