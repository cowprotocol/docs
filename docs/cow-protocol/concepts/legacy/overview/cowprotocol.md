## CoW Protocol

CoW Protocol develops tools for highly efficient, decentralized trading solutions.The proliferation of tokens, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and DeFi actions, as well as the rise of MEV bots has vastly complicated the DeFi environment. CoW Protocol aims to minimize this complexity and provide a simple, but optimal, trading experience for users. Trusted third parties, known as solvers, abstract complexity away by executing orders on behalf of the trader through an intents-based model. Solvers pick up a user’s intent and chart a path to optimal execution of the order from liquidity across all AMMs and DEX aggregators. They can sometimes even beat on-chain prices by tapping into exclusive off-chain inventory and match user trades peer-to-peer through what we call a Coincidence of Wants (CoW). Finally, solvers compete against each other to determine which solvers will provide the best execution path for the trade, ensuring that users benefit the most in the end.Essentially, the CoW Protocol network of solvers acts as a matching engine, settling user intents against on-chain infrastructure or directly against available counterparties.- **New to CoW?** We recommend starting off with an Introduction to CoW Protocol
