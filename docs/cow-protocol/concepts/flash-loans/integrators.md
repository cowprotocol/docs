# How to specify an order with flash loan

The flash loan is encoded into the [appData](/cow-protocol/reference/core/intents/app-data)'s metadata as an optional object. This information serves as a hint for the solver, but the solver ultimately can decide for a different approach in order to make the operation more optimal.

It is important to ensure that the flash loan gas overhead is added to the slippage tolerance when creating the order.

```json
{
  "flashloan": {
    "lender": "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111",
    "borrower": "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222",
    "token": "0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7",
    "amount": "1000000"
  }
}
````

- **lender (optional):** the contract that could be used to borrow the funds from. For example `0x60744434d6339a6B27d73d9Eda62b6F66a0a04FA` for Maker DAO, or `0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2` for AAVE.
- **borrower (optional):** who should receive the borrowed tokens.
- **token:** the token that needs to get borrowed.
- **amount:** how many atoms of the token need to get borrowed (e.g., 1 `WETH` would be 10ยนโธ).

If optional values were not provided the solver will choose sensible defaults.
