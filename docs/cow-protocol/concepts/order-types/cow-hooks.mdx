# CoW Hooks

CoW Hooks allow users to pair any Ethereum action (or set of actions) with an order on CoW Protocol, leveraging the [solvers](../introduction/solvers) to execute the actions together in the sequence. 

Hooks come in two flavors, [**"pre-hooks"**](#pre-hooks) and [**"post-hooks"**](#post-hooks).

## Pre-Hooks

These are actions that execute before the swap, allowing pre-hooks to be used to "set up" an order. Some examples including:

- Unstaking tokens just-in-time for trading
- Claiming an airdrop right before dumping
- Signing token approvals so that the approval and the trade itself are batched together as a single action

## Post-Hooks

These are actions that execute after the swap, taking advantage of trade proceeds. Examples include: 

- Bridging funds to L2s
- Staking funds

## Getting started

To get started with writing a CoW Hook, check out [our technical documentation](/cow-protocol/reference/core/intents/hooks). You can also [read more about CoW Hooks on our blog](https://blog.cow.fi/cow-hooks-you-are-in-control-480ccb40044a).
