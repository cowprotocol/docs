# CoW Hooks

CoW Hooks allow users to pair any Ethereum action (or set of actions) with a swap on CoW Protocol, leveraging the [solvers](cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/solvers) to execute the actions together in the sequence. 

Hooks come in two flavors:

**"Pre-hooks"** — These are actions that execute before the swap, allowing pre-hooks to be used to "set up" an order. Some examples including:

- Unstaking tokens just-in-time for trading
- Claiming an airdrop right before dumping
- Signing token approvals so that the approval and the trade itself are batched together as a single action

**"Post-hooks"** — These are actions that execute after the swap, taking advantage of trade proceeds. Examples include: 

- Bridging funds to L2s
- Staking funds

**Notes**: Hook execution is not guaranteed, meaning that a pre-hook or post-hook action may fail while the swap it is attached to still goes through. It may be useful to set up your hooks in such a way so that the trade is only possible if a pre-hook goes through (e.g. by setting the required token allowance as a necessary pre-hook for a given token trade). Additionally, hook execution is not enforced by the CoW Protocol smart contracts. Solvers must include hook orders as part of the social consensus rules.
