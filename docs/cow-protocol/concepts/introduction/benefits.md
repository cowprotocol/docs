# Overall Benefits (USPs)

CoW Protocol has a wide range of benefits, both technical and functional:

* Fully permissionless Meta DEX Aggregator on which anyone can trade any tokens and build integrations
* First implementation (2nd iteration) of batch auctions promoting fair uniform clearing prices
* Protection from MEV, including frontrunning and sandwich attacks
* Access to vast liquidity: 
    * Best prices when CoWs are found
    * Aggregation of the latest on-chain liquidity sources 
    * Connection to private liquidity from market makers
* Off-chain order submission that enables gasless trading, meaning users don’t need ETH in their wallets for trading
    * In addition, thanks to permittable approvals, some tokens can be approved via signed messages instead of transactions, allowing for a completely gasless trading experience
* Fair, decentralized settlement in which an open competition for order matching replaces a central operator or a Constant Function Market Maker (CFMM)
* Tokenomics that ensure solvers deliver the best order settlement solution for traders in exchange for the reward of each batch auction
* CoW Hooks, through which any user can deploy any sort of DeFi interaction in the form of intents
* Industry-leading security since users only have to approve one smart contract and the solvers handle all other approvals (including risky ones)
