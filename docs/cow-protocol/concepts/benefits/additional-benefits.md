# Additional benefits

CoW Protocol's [intent-based trading model](../introduction/intents) provides a number of benefits, including support for expressing any intent, MEV protection, and price improvement. There are also a handful of additional benefits unique to CoW Protocol thanks to its specific architecture: 

- Gasless trades (users pay settlement fees in their sell token; settlement fees can be lower than gas fees if the trade is included in a batch)
- No fees for failed or cancelled orders (most exchanges make users pay gas fees regardless of whether their order executes or not)
- Order settlement at Ethereum Best Bid Offer or better
- Support for placing multiple orders at once
- Slippage protection on all orders
