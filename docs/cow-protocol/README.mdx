# CoW Protocol

CoW Protocol is a meta-DEX aggregation protocol that leverages [trade intents](cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/intents) and [batch auctions](cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/batch-auctions) to find users better prices for crypto trades.

The protocol relies on third parties known as "[solvers](cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/solvers)" to find the best execution paths for trade intents â€” signed messages that specify conditions for executing transaction on Ethereum and EVM-compatable chains. 

Upon first receiving a user intent, the protocol groups it alongside other pending intents in a [batch](cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/batch-auctions). When executing trade intents, solvers first try to find a [*Coincidence of Wants (CoW)](cow-protocol/concepts/introduction/coincidence-of-wants)* within the existing batch to offer an optimal price over any on-chain market maker. If the protocol does not find a CoW, the solvers search all available on-chain and off-chain liquidity to find the best price for a set of trade intents within a batch.

Liquidity sources include:

- AMMs (e.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer, Curve, etc.)
- DEX Aggregators (e.g. 1inch, Paraswap, Matcha, etc.)
- Private Market Makers (e.g. 0x, Hashflow, Bebop, etc.)

This delegated trade execution architecture makes CoW Protocol a meta-DEX aggregator, or an aggregator of aggregators.
