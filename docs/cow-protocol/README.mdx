# CoW Protocol (Batch Auctions)

CoW Protocol matches users' intents via batch auctions from a variety of on-chain liquidity sources.

When matching intents, CoW Protocol first seeks a _Coincidence of Wants_ (CoW) within the existing batch to offer an even better price than any pool/market maker can. If no CoW is found, CoW Protocol then seeks the best price for a trade from available on-chain liquidity.

On-chain liquidity sources include: 
- AMMs (e.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer, Curve, etc.)
- DEX Aggregators (e.g. 1inch, Paraswap, Matcha, etc.)

Therefore, CoW Protocol is essentially an aggregator of aggregators.
