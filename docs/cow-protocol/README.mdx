# CoW Protocol (Batch Auctions)

CoW Protocol matches users' intents via batch auctions from a variety of on-chain liquidity sources and private market makers.

When matching intents, CoW Protocol first seeks a _Coincidence of Wants_ (CoW) within the existing batch to offer an even better price than any pool/market maker can. If no CoW is found, CoW Protocol solvers then seek the best price for the trade from available on-chain liquidity.

On-chain liquidity sources include: 
- AMMs (e.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer, Curve, etc).
- DEX Aggregators (e.g. 1inch, Paraswap, Matcha, etc).
- Private Market Makers (e.g. 0x, Hashflow, Bebop, etc).

Therefore, CoW Protocol is essentially an aggregator of aggregators.
