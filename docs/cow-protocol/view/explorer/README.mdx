# CoW Explorer

[CoW Protocol Explorer](https://explorer.cow.fi) is an "[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)" like interface for the CoW Protocol. It allows users to visualize the orders have placed on the protocol, as well as the orders that have been executed, across all networks that the protocol is deployed on.

Users may search for:

- Order details by `orderID`
- Orders placed by a specific user's `address`
- Orders settled by a specific batch auction's `transactionHash`
