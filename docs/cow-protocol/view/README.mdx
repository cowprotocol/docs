# Viewing orders

As CoW Protocol utilizes an off-chain order-book, and settles on-chain, getting a holistic view of the current state of CoW Protocol requires a combination of on-chain and off-chain data. Individually, this information is available from the following:

- [OrderBook API](/docs/cow-protocol/reference/apis/orderbook) (off-chain)
- [CoW Protocol Subgraph](/docs/cow-protocol/analyze/subgraph) (on-chain)

Switching between these tools, and reading raw JSON data is better suited for computers, not humans. To make it easier to view the current state of CoW Protocol, we've built a tool that combines the two, providing a convenient and holistic view of the current state of CoW Protocol.

Enter the [CoW Protocol Explorer](./view/explorer) 🐮🔎.
