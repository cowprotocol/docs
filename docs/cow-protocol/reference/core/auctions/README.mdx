# Batch Auction mechanism

Cow Protocol uses batch auctions for executing trades. Within a given batch, the goal is to compute prices and traded amounts in order to maximize a well-defined *utility function*. This can be formulated as a concrete optimization problem that needs to be solved, and this is where the Solvers comes into place.

Informally, a _Solver_ is an algorithm that takes as input a batch auction _instance_ and outputs a batch auction _solution_, both described precisely in a formal language. The solution is then processed by the Protocol, which validates all Solver candidate solutions and ranks them according to a well-defined objective function.
