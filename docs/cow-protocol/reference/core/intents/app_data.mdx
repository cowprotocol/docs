# Application specific data

There are times when attaching additional information to an order is useful. For example:

* An integration partner might want to track the volume they bring to the protocol
* A user might want to include a referral address in their order
* A user might want to specify additional order options, such as [CoW Hooks](/cow-protocol/reference/core/intents/hooks)

CoW Protocol facilitates the inclusion of this additional information to any order through a special data field known as [`appData`](../../contracts/core/settlement#gpv2orderdata-struct). This field is a `bytes32` that points to an IPFS document that is a JSON file containing this information. Utilizing only on-chain data and IPFS, the content of this document can be retrieved and parsed.

## AppData Document

The AppData document is a JSON file that follows a specific JSON [schema](#schema). It is versioned and the version is specified in the document itself. Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

An example of an AppData document is:

```json
{
  "version": "0.10.0",
  "appCode": "MyAwesomeUi",
  "metadata": {
    "referral": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
  }
}
```

:::tip

Avoid all the pain of creating and parsing `appData` by using either the:

* [CoW Explorer appData utility](https://explorer.cow.fi/appdata?tab=encode); or
* [app-data](../../sdks/app-data) SDK

:::

:::caution

If not using the CoW Explorer appData utility or the app-data SDK, make sure to follow the [appData schema](#schema) and upload your file to IPFS before placing orders using the resulting digest.

## Schema

The schema for the AppData document is defined in [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/). The schema is available in the [app-data](../../sdks/app-data) SDK. The schema is shown below:

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={ appDataSchema } />
