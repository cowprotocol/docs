# Application specific data

There are times when attaching additional information to an order is useful. For example:

* An integration partner might want to track the volume they bring to the protocol
* A user might want to include a referral address in their order
* A user might want to specify additional order options, such as CoW Hooks

CoW Protocol facilitates the inclusion of this additional information to any order through a special data field known as [`appData`](../../contracts/core/settlement#gpv2-data-struct). This field is a `bytes32` that points to an IPFS document that is a JSON file containing this information. Utilizing only on-chain data and IPFS, the content of this document can be retrieved and parsed.

## AppData Document

The AppData document is a JSON file that follows a specific JSON [schema](#schema). It is versioned and the version is specified in the document itself. Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

An example of an AppData document is:

```json
{
  "version": "0.10.0",
  "appCode": "MyAwesomeUi",
  "metadata": {
    "referral": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
  }
}
```

:::tip

Avoid all the pain of creating and parsing `appData` by using either the:

* [CoW Explorer appData utility](https://explorer.cow.fi/appdata?tab=encode); or
* [app-data](../../sdks/app-data) SDK

:::

:::caution

If not using the CoW Explorer appData utility or the app-data SDK, make sure to follow the [appData schema](#schema) and ensure the JSON generated is **deterministic** when creating your own `appData` documents!

:::

### `appCode`

The `appCode` is a string that identifies the tool that created the order. It is used to track the volume each integration partner brings to the protocol. For example, the `appCode` for CoW Swap is `CoW Swap`.

There are already some dapps using `appCode` such as:

- Aura
- Balancer
- Cow Swap
- DeFi Llama
- Dump.services
- Raise Finance
- Safe
- ShapeShift
- Swapr
- Yearn Finance

Using the `appCode` is optional, but integrations / dapps are encouraged to use it. Doing so allows tracking the volume each integration partner brings to the protocol at the Dune Analytics [partner dashboard](https://dune.com/cowprotocol/cow-swap-integration-partner-dashboard). Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cowprotocol) to get your `appCode` added to the dashboard.

### `metadata`

Metadata is an object that contains additional _optional_ information such as:

- Referral address
- [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters)
- Additional order options, such as CoW Hooks

:::note

UTM parameters are generally used by internal teams to track the performance of their marketing campaigns. They are not intended to be used by end users.

:::

### `metadata.hooks`

CoW Hooks are a way to extend CoW Protocol orders allowing for more advanced swap intents to be specified, while being signed and by virtue of being included in order's `appData`. Thus, going from an trading engine to an execution engine.

```json
{
  "version": "0.10.0",
  "appCode": "MyAwesomeUi",
  "metadata": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre": [
        {
          "target": "<address>",
          "callData": "<hex encoded bytes>",
          "gasLimit": "<number>"
        }
      ],
      "post": [
        {
          "target": "<address>",
          "callData": "<hex encoded bytes>",
          "gasLimit": "<number>"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip

Both `pre` and `post` hooks support multiple hooks, so feel free to mix and match!

:::

:::caution

All hooks are executed with the context of the [`HooksTrampoline`](../../contracts/periphery/hooks-trampoline). This means that the `msg.sender` will be the `HooksTrampoline` and not the order creator.

## Schema

The schema for the AppData document is defined in [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/). The schema is available in the [app-data](../../sdks/app-data) SDK. The schema is shown below:

<JSONSchemaViewer schema={ appDataSchema } />
