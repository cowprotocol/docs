# Intents

Within CoW Protocol, intents are the way that a user expresses their desire to swap tokens. An intent is a combination of the tokens they wish to swap, the amount they wish to swap, and the price they wish to swap at.

## Parameters

### Batch auction

The [batch-optimization problem](auctions/the-problem) requires that a user specify the:

* tokens to swap (i.e. `sellToken` and `buyToken`)
* amounts to swap (i.e. `sellAmount` and `buyAmount`)
* kind of swap (ie. `sell` or `buy`)
* partial fillability (ie. `true` or `false`)
* fees payable to the protocol (ie. `feeAmount`)

### Co-ordination / Settlement

For co-ordination and settlement purposes, the Protocol requires the user to specify the:

* address to send the tokens to (i.e. `receiver` of the `buyToken`)
* validity of the order (i.e. `validTo`)
* application specific data (i.e. `appData`)
* source of the `sellToken` (i.e. `sellTokenBalance`)
* destination of the `buyToken` (i.e. `buyTokenBalance`)

:::note

Some parameters that are of primary consideration for co-ordination / settlement may be of secondary consideration for the batch auction. For example, the `receiver` of the `buyToken` may be set to another address which requires storage slot to be initialized from zero, increasing the gas cost of the transaction and impacting the solution to the batch-optimization problem.
