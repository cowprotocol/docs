# Intents

Within CoW Protocol, intents are the way that a user expresses their desired swap outcome.

## Parameters

The parameters required for an intent can be broken down into three categories:

* [Batch auction](#batch-auction) parameters - those required to solve the [batch-optimization problem](auctions/the-problem)
* [Co-ordination / Settlement](#co-ordination-settlement) parameters - those required for co-ordination and settlement purposes
* [Metadata](#metadata) parameters - those required for metadata purposes

### Batch auction

* tokens to swap (i.e. `sellToken` and `buyToken`)
* amounts to swap (i.e. `sellAmount` and `buyAmount`)
* kind of swap (ie. `sell` or `buy`)
* partial fillability (ie. `true` or `false`)
* fees payable to the protocol (ie. `feeAmount`)

### Co-ordination / Settlement

* address to send the tokens to (i.e. `receiver` of the `buyToken`)
* validity of the order (i.e. `validTo`)
* source of the `sellToken` (i.e. `sellTokenBalance`)
* destination of the `buyToken` (i.e. `buyTokenBalance`)

### Metadata

* application specific data (i.e. `appData`)

:::note

Some parameters that are of primary consideration for co-ordination / settlement may be of secondary consideration for the batch auction. For example, the `receiver` of the `buyToken` may be set to another address which requires storage slot to be initialized from zero, increasing the gas cost of the transaction and impacting the solution to the batch-optimization problem.
