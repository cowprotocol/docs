# Programmatic orders

Programmatic orders are generally peripheral contracts that are not necessary for CoW Protocol, but that all implemented on (or implement) the Programmatic Order Framework.

## Deployments

:::tip

CoW Protocol contracts are generally deployed to the same addresses on their respective deployment chains. This may be done either via using determinsitic deployments (`CREATE2`), or ensuring that the deployer uses a consistent `nonce` via `CREATE` for deployment.
