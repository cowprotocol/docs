# Core

Core contracts of CoW Protocol are those that are necessary for the protocol to function.

## Architecture

The goal of the protocol is to bundle multiple user orders together to minimize fees deriving from using external liquidity sources and stave off maximal extractable value.

User orders are signed off-chain and sent to the protocol. [Solvers compete in an auction](../core/auctions/rewards) to settle the orders. Orders without a direct match are settled by the solver using on-chain liquidity sources through the use of _interactions_.

A settlement is a list of orders traded together, their prices, and the on-chain interactions necessary to retrieve external liquidity.

To achieve this, the protocol needs to be able to:

* Collect and verify user orders, interact with on-chain liquidity, store information on the state of the orders
* Determine which addresses are solvers
* Firewall user funds from solvers

#### Guarantees and Invariants

1. User funds are **NOT** accessible _except_ for settling an order authorized by the user
2. A trade **MUST** be executed at the _limit price or better_ as specified in the order
3. Once an order is fulfilled, it **CANNOT** be traded again

## Deployments

:::tip

CoW Protocol contracts are deployed using deterministic addresses. This means that the same contract code will always be deployed to the same address. This is done by using the `CREATE2` opcode.

    <summary>Upgradeable allow-list</summary>

The allow-list is upgradeable to facilitate future decentralization of the protocol. Reasons to upgrade the allow-list include if CowDAO decides to:

- add/remove solvers
- change the logic for who is a solver (such as automating a stake requirement)

The security considerations of upgradeability are discussed in the [GPv2AllowlistAuthentication](core/allowlist#guarantees-and-invariants) section.
