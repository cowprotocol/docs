# Core

Core contracts of CoW Protocol are those that are necessary for the protocol to function.

## Architecture

The goal of the protocol is to bundle multiple user orders together to minimize fees deriving from using external liquidity sources and stave off maximal extractable value.

User orders are signed off-chain and sent to the protocol. [Solvers compete in an auction](../core/auctions/rewards) to settle the orders. Orders without a direct match are settled by the solver using on-chain liquidity sources through the use of _interactions_.

A settlement is a list of orders traded together, their prices, and the on-chain interactions necessary to retrieve external liquidity.

To achieve this, the protocol needs to be able to:

* Collect and verify user orders, interact with on-chain liquidity, store information on the state of the orders
* Determine which addresses are solvers
* Firewall user funds from solvers

#### Guarantees and Invariants

1. User funds are **NOT** accessible _except_ for settling an order authorized by the user
2. A trade **MUST** be executed at the _limit price or better_ as specified in the order
3. Once an order is fulfilled, it **CANNOT** be traded again

## Deployments

:::tip

CoW Protocol contracts are deployed using deterministic addresses. This means that the same contract code will always be deployed to the same address. This is done by using the `CREATE2` opcode.

:::

:::caution

Take care when [signing](../core/signing-schemes), ensuring that the `EIP-712` domain separator is specified correctly.

<details close>
    <summary>Upgradeable allow-list</summary>

The allow-list is upgradeable to facilitate future decentralization of the protocol. Reasons to upgrade the allow-list include if CoWDAO decides to:

- add/remove solvers
- change the logic for who is a solver (such as automating a stake requirement)

The security considerations of upgradeability are discussed in the [GPv2AllowlistAuthentication](core/allowlist#guarantees-and-invariants) section.

## Security / Known Issues

### Partially fillable orders with zero amounts

If a user creates an order with:

* `sellAmount = 0`
* `buyAmount = 0`
* `partiallyFillable = true`

Then this order could be executed an arbitrary amount of times instead of just a single time.
This means that any solver could drain the fee amount from the user until not enough funds are available anymore.

:::tip

Never sign orders with `sellAmount = 0` and/or `buyAmount = 0`.
If developing smart contracts that create orders, make sure at a contract level that such orders cannot be created.

:::

### `ERC-1271` Replayability

The security of [`ERC-1271`](../core/signing-schemes#erc-1271) signatures depend on the developers' implementation of the _signing smart contract_.
Different smart contract wallets sign and verify messages very differently from each other.

There's a known issue in some smart-contract wallet implementations that should be known before using `ERC-1271` signatures on CoW Protocol.

#### Signature Replayability

On some popular smart-contract wallets, the signature of an owner is replayable: this means that if an address is an owner of two smart-contract wallets then a signature for the first wallet may also be a valid signature for the second wallet.

CoW Protocol only checks if the signature is valid; it doesn't know which wallet the signature was intended for.
This means that an order signed by a wallet with replayable signatures could be executed by another wallet owned by the same owner.

As a general recommendation, you should never sign any message with `ERC-1271` on wallets whose signature are replayable.
CoW Protocol can't protect your order from this attack at a protocol level.

:::tip

Signatures from a Safe wallet aren't replayable and don't require any special handling.

:::

#### Mitigation

You are still able to create `ERC-1271` orders from any wallet.

The CoW Protocol API allows you to specify some signed [metadata](../core/intents/app-data) in the order. This metadata can be sent along when creating an order on the CoW Protocol API.

The signer property in the `metadata` is used by the CoW Protocol API to check that the signature is meant for the specified wallet.
If this doesn't match the order origin, the order is rejected.
A minimal example of app data is the following:

```json
{ "metadata": { "signer": "0x291cf356e5639fb4c19ba5bfb4e2f8f82b371573" } }
```

where `0x29..73` is the address of the smart-contract wallet that uses `ERC-1271` to sign the order.

However, the CoW Protocol API must know the *full* metadata in advance for rejecting unknown orders, and by default you don't need to reveal the entire metadata when you submit the order, only its hash (the app data).
Once your order is created, the metadata will be permanently stored in the database and linked to the app data; no one will be able to post a replayed order on the CoW Protocol API for a different wallet.

If your signature is valid before your order is submitted and you want to make sure that the no one uses it before your order is submitted on the API, you can send the metadata to the API in advance.
Then, any incoming order with the same app data hash will be rejected if the smart contract wallet doesn't match.

The metadata can be sent in advance to the [API](/cow-protocol/reference/apis/orderbook) using the `PUT` method `/app_data/{app_data_hash}`.

:::caution

This process only prevents the order from being created in the CoW Protocol API.
A malicious solver would still be able to replay a signature when submitting a transaction on-chain.
However, as long as the metadata is known, this abuse will be detected upon inclusion of the transaction in a block and the solver will be penalized by the amount of the misused order.

:::

### EIP-712 cached domain separator

To maximise gas efficiency the [domain separator](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-domainseparator) for the `GPv2Settlement` contract is initialized in the constructor and cached for all subsequent invocations.
Therefore, any signatures for a chain on which the `GPv2Settlement` contract has been deployed are replayable _on any subsequent fork of that chain_ (such as ETHPOW forking Ethereum mainnet).

### Loss of surplus if `ERC-1271` order allows arbitrary app data

An adversary can manipulate vulnerable [`ERC-1271`](../core/signing-schemes#erc-1271) orders, thereby transferring part of the expected surplus from the user order to an address that the adversary controls.

This applies to all `ERC-1271` orders where the [app data](/cow-protocol/reference/core/intents/app-data) field can be changed by an adversary in a way that keeps the signature valid for that order (for example, because `isValidSignature` ignores the `appData` field in the order).

All `ERC-1271` smart-contract order types that can be found in these docs are not affected by this vulnerability.
However, custom smart-contract order implementations may be affected: as usual, users should exercise caution when trading through unvetted smart-contract orders.

This vulnerability is particularly relevant to developers who are implementing their own smart-contract order type.
Possibly the easiest way to avoid being affected by this issue is:

1. making the app data immutable at deployment time (or equal to `bytes(0)`), and
2. have `isValidSignature` reject an order if the app data doesn't match.

But as long as untrusted parties cannot manipulate the app data of a valid `ERC-1271` order, an implementation is not affected.

The mechanism that allows surplus extraction from arbitrary app data possible is [partner fees](/governance/fees/partner-fee).
Partner fees are encoded in the app data struct and are accounted for once the order is included in the settlement.

From the perspective of the API, two orders with the same parameters and the same owner but different app data are two different valid orders.
It can happen that the order that is part of the final settlement is the one controlled by the adversary, especially if other order parameters can be changed to create the appearence of an inflated surplus.
In this case, the order surplus decreases as partner fees are taken from the surplus.
