# Performance Benchmark

In the following [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19708), we perform
an empirical comparison of four major MEV protection RPCs—MEV Blocker, Flashbots,
Blink, and Merkle—by evaluating their execution quality for the exact same transactions.
Through a systematic analysis of transaction outcomes, we examine how their different OFA
designs impact user benefits, shedding light on how order flow providers should carefully
pay attention to marketing claims and thoroughly review to whom they are sending their
transactions to.

From these comparisons, we can rank each RPC service provider based on the different
metrics. MEV Blocker stands out for being the only RPC that is either the best or among
the best in all metrics. . Flashbot ranks similarly or just below MEV blocker in time to
inclusion and backrun value. However, its execution price is the lowest among all RPCs.
Finally Merkle and Blink both generate very low rebates. Also, Merkle stands out for its
low success rate.
