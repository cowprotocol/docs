# Searchers

If you are interested in searching on MEV Blockers, you simply need to connect to our websocket to start backruning! MEV Blocker private mempool broadcasts an auction for every transaction it receives on the “backrunnable endpoints”. The auction reveals certain parts of the transaction that searchers can use to post a backrun bid.

Searchers looking to connect to MEV Blocker’s open marketplace on Ethereum will need to understand the following sections.

* Listen to transactions
* Bid on Transactions

The above methods are for backrunning general flow for MEV Blocker, however, there is also the possibility of backruning CoW Swap flow. In order to do so, and because of the itnriquises and complexity of CoW Swaps solver settlements, Searchers need to be whitelisted.

There are two ways to get whitelisted:

* Meritocracy → become one of the best searchers on MEV Blocker and we will contact you via [Telegram](https://t.me/mevblocker) to whitelist your address
* Go through a KYC process → Please reach out via [contact@](mailto:@mevblocker.io) or [Telegram](https://t.me/mevblocker) to get whitelisted and to get access to the CoW Swap’s websocket for biding on transactions.
