# Set Up Data Analytics

When submitting your transaction to the API, define the custom parameter “referrer=xxx" to associate transactions on MEV Blocker's transaction origin analytics dashboard to your project:

```
https://rpc.mevblocker.io/?referrer=(YOUR_ADDRESS)
```

By setting up a referrer address, you allow MEV Blocker team to more easily track the order flow you create and to more easily detect and fix issues.
