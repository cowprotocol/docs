MEV Blocker's order flow auction protects user transactions from frontrunning and sandwich attacks — the worst types of MEV — by sending transactions to a private mempool of trusted searchers. These searchers then capture any backrunning opportunities left by user transactions and give up to 90% of their value back to the users.

- **MEV Protection**: Public mempool transactions are vulnerable to MEV attacks like frontrunning and sandwich attacks, causing millions in weekly losses. MEV Blocker's private pool protects you from these type of attacks.
- **MEV Rebates**: MEV Blocker lets searchers bid to backrun transactions, returning 90% as user rebates and using 10% to reward builders and validators, reclaiming value and enabling wallet and dApp revenue.
- **Faster Transaction Inclusion**: MEV Blocker bypasses the public Ethereum mempool, forwarding transactions directly to major builders for quicker inclusion.
