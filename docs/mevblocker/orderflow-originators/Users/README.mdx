# Individual Users

Individual users are also able to connect to MEV Blocker RPC by updating their Wallet's RPC. The way in which you are able to do this varies from wallet to wallet. 

*Note that you may also want to pick a specific endpoint instead of default one. Check MEV Blockers Endpoints here

## Manually add the RPC

**Network Name:** MEV Blocker RPC

**RPC URL:** 

```jsx
https://rpc.mevblocker.io/
```

**Chain ID:** 1 

**Currency Symbol:** ETH 

**Block Explorer:** https://etherscan.io

### If your wallet does not support custom RPCs, reach out to them and tell them to either integrate directly MEV Blocker or to allow for custom RPC.
