# Builders

Builders receiving MEV blocker transactions should adhere to certain rules and also pay a fee to MEV blocker. The proceeds of the fee are used to support MEV blocker technical development and drive continuous growth in users' adoption. 

To connect to MEV Blocker and start receiving private order flow, builders must meet the following basic requirements:

- **Build ≥1% of mainnet blocks consistently**  
  You must have built at least 1% of Ethereum mainnet blocks *per week* during the past month.  
  We reserve the right to disconnect builders who drop significantly below this threshold.

- **Post a 10 ETH bond**  
  A refundable security deposit is required to join the network.  
  It is held in the MEV Blocker contract and covers potential penalties or late fees.

- **Support for core features**  
  Builders must implement:
  - **Refund bundles**
  - **`replacementUuid` (or `uuid`)** for updateable bundles
  - **Tx hash dropping** (to support dynamic bundle resolution)

- **Maintain ethical execution**  
  Builders must refrain from any behavior that harms MEV Blocker users, including but not limited to:
  - Frontrunning or sandwiching  
  - Sharing or leaking transaction/state data  
  - Selectively including transactions or manipulating refund outcomes

- **No shadow identities or fee evasion**  
  Builders must not attempt to bypass the fee mechanism by operating "shadow builders" or other manipulative schemes.

- **Reach out to get started**  
  Final onboarding and access to flow are coordinated via the MEV Blocker Telegram group.
