# Builders

MEV Blocker was created to allow anyone to safely use Ethereum, guaranteeing fast inclusion time, protection from attacks, and providing rebates whenever there are profitable backrunning opportunities. Achieving these ambitious objectives requires a source of revenue to support the technical development of the product and to drive continuous growth in users' adoption. Furthermore, MEV Blocker wants to be an open, shared infrastructure. As part of this effort, it is important to have clear and transparent rules determining which builders can receive its flow.

The purpose of this document is to spell out the rules that builders should follow. One of these rules is that builders should pay a fee. This section also explains the fee mechanism and its rationale.
